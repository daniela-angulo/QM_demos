Codes (notebooks) used for teaching Introduction to quantum mechanics. The contents are: 

Superposition: script that outputs a video showing the probability distribution as a function of time for a superposition of two eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator. This was done to show the effects of interference and that superposition had unique features that couldn't be extracted from just thinking of individual eigenstates. 

Potential barrier: finds and plots the solutions for a potential barrier (plane waves and exponential decay). The main thing is to show the propagation of a wavepacket as it gets closer to the barrier. 

Schrodinger solver: this was done in collaboration with the instructor of the course, Amar Vutha. It solves the Schrodinger equation for different potentials. This code emphazises bound states and it was done to support the chapter on sketching wave functions. 

Time evolver: this was done in collaboration with Amar Vutha. This code is based on the Schrodinger solver and adds the time evolution of a wavepacket inside potentials.
